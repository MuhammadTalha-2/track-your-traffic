            <ul style={UL}>
              <li style={LI}><strong>Starter — $10/month:</strong> Core analytics features for small stores</li>

              Subscriptions are billed on a monthly or annual basis, depending on the option you
              select at checkout. Annual billing is paid upfront and typically offers a discounted
              rate compared to monthly billing. All payments are processed by Shopify in accordance
              with their billing terms.
            </p>

              Refunds are available within the 7-day free trial period. After the trial period ends
              and billing has commenced, we do not offer refunds for any partial billing period,
              unused features, or unused time remaining on a subscription. If you believe a charge

              We may update or modify these Terms of Service from time to time at our discretion.
              When we make material changes, we will update the "Last updated" date at the top of
              this page.

              We will notify active merchants of significant changes via an in-app notification
              within the App's dashboard. It is your responsibility to review the updated Terms.
              Your continued use of the App after changes are posted constitutes your acceptance
              of the revised Terms. If you do not agree to the updated Terms, you must stop using
              the App and uninstall it from your store.
